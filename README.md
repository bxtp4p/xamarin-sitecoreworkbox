# xamarin-sitecoreworkbox

This is an example of using Sitecore's Xamarin SDK. I used it to create a simple Workbox browser that allows you to see the workflows you have permissions to and the items in each state of the workflow. I'll probably add the ability to perform at least some of the workflow commands as the next step of this example application.
